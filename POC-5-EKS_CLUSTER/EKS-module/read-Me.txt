AWS IAM Role for EKS Cluster:
This section creates an IAM (Identity and Access Management) role for your EKS cluster.
The role allows the EKS service to assume it, which means EKS can perform certain actions using this role.
The role is attached to a policy named "AmazonEKSClusterPolicy."
Default VPC and Public Subnets:
Here, we retrieve information about the default VPC and its public subnets.
The default VPC is where your EKS cluster will be deployed.
We identify the public subnets within the VPC.
AWS EKS Cluster:
This part creates the EKS cluster itself.
It uses the IAM role created earlier and deploys the cluster in the default VPC's public subnets.
IAM Role for EKS Node Group:
Another IAM role is created, which is meant for the worker nodes in your EKS cluster.
This role allows EC2 instances (worker nodes) to communicate with the EKS cluster.
Attachment of Policies:
Various policies, such as "AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy," "AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy," and "AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly," are attached to the worker node role.
These policies grant permissions to the worker nodes for necessary actions.
Managed Node Group:
The EKS node group represents the worker nodes in your cluster.
It specifies the desired number of nodes, instance types, and other configurations.
The group is associated with the EKS cluster, the role of worker nodes, and the public subnets. https://mrcloudbook.hashnode.dev/provisioning-aws-eks-with-terraform-a-step-by-step-guide
